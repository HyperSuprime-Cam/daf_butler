        """Build a sub-query for a dataset type to be joined with "big join".

        If there is only one collection then there is a guarantee that
        DataIds are all unique (by DataId I mean combination of all link
        values relevant for this dataset), in that case subquery can be
        written as:

            SELECT Dataset.dataset_id AS dataset_id, Dataset.link1 AS link1 ...
            FROM Dataset JOIN DatasetCollection
                ON Dataset.dataset_id = DatasetCollection.dataset_id
            WHERE Dataset.dataset_type_name = :dsType_name
                AND DatasetCollection.collection = :collection_name

        We only have single collection for output DatasetTypes so for them
        subqueries always look like above.

        If there are multiple collections then there can be multiple matching
        Datasets for the same DataId. In that case we need only one Dataset
        record which comes from earliest collection (in the user-provided
        order). Here things become complicated, we have to:
        - replace collection names with their order in input list
        - select all combinations of rows from Dataset and DatasetCollection
          which match collection names and dataset type name
        - from those only select rows with lowest collection position if
          there are multiple collections for the same DataId

        Replacing collection names with positions is easy:

            SELECT dataset_id,
                CASE collection
                    WHEN 'collection1' THEN 0
                    WHEN 'collection2' THEN 1
                    ...
                END AS collorder
            FROM DatasetCollection

        Combined query will look like (CASE ... END is as  above):

            SELECT Dataset.dataset_id AS dataset_id,
                CASE DatasetCollection.collection ... END AS collorder,
                Dataset.DataId
            FROM Dataset JOIN DatasetCollection
                ON Dataset.dataset_id = DatasetCollection.dataset_id
            WHERE Dataset.dataset_type_name = <dsType.name>
                AND DatasetCollection.collection IN (<collections>)

        (here ``Dataset.DataId`` means ``Dataset.link1, Dataset.link2, etc.``)

        Filtering is complicated, it is simpler to use Common Table Expression
        (WITH clause) but not all databases support CTEs so we will have to do
        with the repeating sub-queries. Use GROUP BY for DataId and
        MIN(collorder) to find ``collorder`` for given DataId, then join it
        with previous combined selection:
